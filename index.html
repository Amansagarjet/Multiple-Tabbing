                    <p>Tabs are often used in software engineering when developing computer programs or storing and
                        manipulating data in files. They can help guide the flow of reading and add semantic structure
                        to the code or data.
                        Some advantages of using tabs include: Saving space, Adjustability, and Increasing
                        accessibility.
                        However, some coders prefer the more specific alignment that spaces provide. The debate about
                        tabs versus spaces is not just technical, but also philosophical, about whose responsibility it
                        is to specify indentation.</p>
